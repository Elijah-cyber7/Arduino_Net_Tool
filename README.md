This code is meant to run on a WeMos D1 mini with an IC2 OLED display and an array of push buttons.
Right now it simply monitors packet traffic and will display all avalible SSIDs.
There is a start to a deathentication function but I havent gotten around to it. 
This was built in 2022 while I was studying networking.
